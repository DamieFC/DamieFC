## What I'm working on
I'm working on Platypus OS, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Platypus-Tech/new-platypus-os-drafts). That's consuming most of my time. I actually have a lot of OS's I'm working on, including one that's actually following the rules, [explodeOS](https://github.com/DamieFC/explodeOS), using guides and stuff from OSDev. I actually do work on other things other than OS's, I have my assembly language started from a joke on Discord, [org-asm](https://github.com/DamieFC/org-asm) (Official quote: "nasm, fasm, masm, and orgasm". My humor is slightly twisted).
## What I'm learning
I'm not learning anything in school, due to there being so many assignments I just have to get them done, I'm learning about Linux kernel organization and functions, and I actually found where the `printk(THING, "string");` function is (with / being the base repository): `/include/linux/printk.h`. I'm hoping to become a Linux kernel contributer soon. I'm also learning how not to get in trouble.
## Reffering to me
I consider myself a boy, so you can refer to me as "he", "him", or just "GNUOVERYOU" or @DamieFC. Doesn't matter. Of course, non-gender specific is fine. I wish people on discord would stop joking about this section.
## Other things
I did a change.org petition to get every unsupported version of Windows open sourced. If you want, you can sign it [here](http://chng.it/69dpmYFQ5s).
