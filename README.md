## What I'm working on
I'm working on Platypus OS, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Platypus-Tech/platypus-os-desktop-pre-alpha). That's consuming most of my time. In my _other_ time, I'm working on a private repository, which is _also_ an OS, but it's based on OpenBSD, and other various things. Also, I'm attempting to not get in trouble for port scanning public WiFi :unamused:
